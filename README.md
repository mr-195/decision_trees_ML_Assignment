# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee attrition using Decision Trees. The dataset, sourced from `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`, is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-attrition-prediction.git
    cd employee-attrition-prediction
    ```
    Note that this step is optional unless you are cloning from the github repository

2. **Install Required Packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Main Script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This script performs the following tasks:
- Reads the dataset
- Builds an initial Decision Tree
- Prints the initial decision tree
- Prunes the tree
- Prints the pruned decision tree
- Evaluates and compares model performance before and after pruning
- Displays classification reports and metrics
